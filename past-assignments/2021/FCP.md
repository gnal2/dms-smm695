For the final course project (fcp), you will handle a real-world dataset. In
particular, you are required to collect, store, manipulate, and analyze
Airbnb data. This data are publicly available via [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html).

## Data

The data are available via Inside
Airbnb under the "[get the data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)" 
section, where you have to collect the latest available
data for _London_. Hence, you must use the following CSVs<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>:


| data            | content                |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| listings.csv.gz | Detailed Listings      |
| calendar.csv.gz | Detailed Calendar Data |
| reviews.csv.gz  | Detailed Review Data   |


## Tasks

You are required to choose your preferred DBMS -- PostgreSQL or MongoDB -- and:

1. Clean, manipulate, and structure data. The expected result is a well-designed dataset that
   complies with the specific approach of the chosen DBMS. 
2. Provide valuable descriptive insights. The expected result is a set of descriptive statistics that
   depicts some interesting trends or noteworthy data characteristics.
3. _[optional]_ Perform an insightful data analysis. For example, you can use the available features
   to classify the offerings or predict their value. You may want to skim through the reference 
   list provided to get some inspiration.

To perform task 1 and 2, you need to use either `SQL` or `MQL`<a href="#note2" id="note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a> (MongoDB query language). 
Alternatively, if you prefer using python, you can leverage `psycopg2` or `pymongo`.
For what concerns task 3, you should use `PySpark` (e.g., you may want to leverage on the
[MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.ml.html) pyspark library).

## Deliverables

By July 16th (8:00 PM, London time), groups have to upload:

* SQL, JS, or Python scripts;
* Supporting documentation (accepted format: .md, .docx, or .pdf) containing:
  * a detailed justification of your design choices;
  * a clear and concise description of the insights coming from descriptive
      statistics obtained;
  * _[optional]_ a clear and concise description of further insights and results obtained 
      analyzing data through PySpark.
